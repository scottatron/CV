      <h2 id="#about-me">About Me<span></span></h2>
      <p>I started as a freelance web developer in New Zealand in 2006 after having worked at <a href="http://www.workingin.com/" title="Jobs in New Zealand Jobs in Australia Jobs in Canada | Working In">Working In</a> for about 5 years. During my time at Working In, I progressed through various roles and ended up as the leader of the web team where I was in charge of directing our external web development company.</p>
      <p>I soon became very keen to put some of my own ideas into practice, so started teaching myself PHP. Around this time I also discovered Ruby on Rails and while didn't start using it until later, did start following it closely and learning about the approaches to software that surrounded it (MVC / Agile / DRY).</p>
      <p>Since then I have continued to work for a variety of my own clients, plus various design studios, primarily building websites, but also a few web applications.</p>
      <p>Typically, my role has been that of a technical lead, implementing the CMS, doing the front end development based on designs provided and looking after deployment, hosting and ongoing maintenance.</p>
      <p>While I consider myself primarily a developer, I feel I have a strong eye for visual design and have often played a role in the design of sites I've worked on.</p>
      <p>I have had experience with a variety of open source content management and other systems, however I have frequently preferred to build something custom. In doing this I have been able to really learn how things work and form strong opinions about creating simple user experiences.</p>
      <p>Early on, I built my own PHP MVC framework and CMS, which really helped me understand the problems that a lot of design patterns were trying to solve, as well as develop a well-reasoned approach when deciding whether to adopt a pre-existing solution or build something myself.</p>
      <p id="hornet">I am a strong believer in the power of open source software, and love to contribute back into the ecosystem whenever I can. While I don't have any significant contributions to speak of at this stage, I do have my own Rails CMS named Hornet which I hope to open source in the near future.</p>
      <p>I'm always striving to improve my skills and love to keep on top of the latest technologies, while at the same time trying to avoid adopting new things because they're new or popular, and instead trying to understand the problems they're designed to solve first.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h2 id="skills">Skills<span></span></h2>
      <p>I prefer to code in Ruby, but still maintain plenty of PHP code.</p>
      <p>I'm very comfortable with HTML and CSS and when possible prefer to use SASS. When it comes to Javascript, I mostly use jQuery, but am starting to push myself to use vanilla Javascript when possible.</p>
      <p>I've primarily used MySQL, had some experience with MS-SQL and used MongoDB on a couple of small projects.</p>
      <p>I'm a Mac and linux user, but am still comfortable getting around on Windows and have been a lover of the command line since my DOS days. I've always run my own linux servers, with Debian and now Ubuntu being my preferred flavours and have started using Chef to configure them.</p>
      <p>I now use Git almost exclusively, apart from a few lingering Subversion repos. Where possible I almost always prefer to deploy via Capistrano.</p>
      <p>I prefer to use Rspec, Factory Girl, and Capybara and while it's taken me a while to get comfortable with having testing as part of my workflow, I am starting to feel like I've got a hold on it. I've not yet tried using a CI server, but it's definitely on my radar as my test suites start to grow.</p>

        <p>I have been working with ACM to continue development of their fault tracking system used by their engineers and arcades to report and manage faults with their gaming machines.</p>
        <p>This has involved taking a half finished new version of their system written in PHP (over 100,000 lines of spaghetti code) and fixing bugs, completely re-implementing some features, and restructuring the code to improve maintainability.</p>
        <p>I have also now implemented a mixed PHP and Rails environment, so that all new and re-implemented features are in Rails and are backed with tests.</p>
